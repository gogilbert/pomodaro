Pomodoro Timer is a multi-functional timer tool, providing you with a regular timer, a pomodoro timer, and a stopwatch tool.

This project was my introduction to using HTML, manipulating HTML using Javascript, and styling the HTML using CSS.

Currently, most of the styling efforts are focused on the pomodoro timer, the main feature of the program.

## What is a pomodoro timer?
A pomodoro timer is a timer in which you take work "laps". Each lap is 25 minutes long, with a 5 minute break in between each lap. After 4 laps, you get rewarded with a 20 minute break.
